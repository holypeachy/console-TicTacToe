# ❌⭕ Console Tic-Tac-Toe
#### Tic-Tac-Toe game as a console app. I made this for a Udemy course I took.
- Nothing cool going on here, just TicTacToe.

## ✅ Possible Improvements
- Redo from scratch, maybe with a GUI. (it's alright, feels weird to look at old code)

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- .NET 6

## 🚀 Getting Started
Please don't
```bash
git clone git@github.com:holypeachy/console-TicTacToe.git
cd console-TicTacToe
dotnet run
```
